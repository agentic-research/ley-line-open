//! ADR-0020 Gate 2 falsifiability test for `ComplexBuildPass`.
//!
//! Closes bead `ley-line-open-c7eae2`. The gate exists specifically to
//! prove the math layer is load-bearing — that the pass mechanically
//! reaches `leyline_sheaf::CellComplex::new` + `add_node` + `add_edge`
//! and `CoChangeTracker::observe`, and that δ⁰ actually executes on
//! the produced complex.
//!
//! Math-friend §3 (spy pattern): "Production impl forwards directly to
//! `CellComplex`. Test impl is a `RecordingSink` that records every
//! call AND constructs the real `CellComplex` underneath." Plus the
//! simplest sufficient post-condition: `cx.build_delta_0().nnz() > 0`,
//! which is impossible to satisfy without `leyline-sheaf` machinery
//! actually running.
//!
//! ## Falsifiability
//!
//! Each of these assertions FAILS if the pass were short-circuited:
//!
//! - `RecordingSink::open_calls == 1` — fails if `CellComplex::new`
//!   never gets constructed.
//! - `RecordingSink::node_calls.len() == expected_unique_tokens` —
//!   fails if `add_node` is skipped or token deduplication breaks.
//! - `RecordingSink::edge_calls.len() == expected_cooccurrence_pairs` —
//!   fails if `add_edge` is skipped, edges aren't canonicalized, or
//!   the co-occurrence formula collapses to no pairs.
//! - `cx.build_delta_0().nnz() > 0` — fails if the complex is empty,
//!   if stalks aren't seeded, or if restriction maps are missing.
//!   Math-friend §3: "impossible to satisfy without leyline-sheaf
//!   machinery actually running."
//! - `tracker_calls.len() == observations.len()` — fails if
//!   `CoChangeTracker::observe` is never invoked or called with the
//!   wrong shape.
//! - `tracker_call_with_nonempty_changes_exists` — fails on the empty-
//!   `all_edges` silent-failure mode math-friend §4 names.
